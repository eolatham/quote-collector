# TODO

- Add launch screen (see [here](https://betterprogramming.pub/launch-screen-with-swiftui-bd2958771f3b))
- Add ability to sort `Quotes` specifically by author's last name
- Add ability to search and sort `Quotes` by tags
- Add ability to search for quotes in any `QuoteCollection`
  - This can be done by adding a default and immutable `QuoteCollection` called "All Quotes"
- Finish `QuoteView` (add copy/share/edit functionality)
  - The user should be able to change `Quote` text, author, and collection attribute values
