# TODO

- Finish `QuoteView` (add copy/share/edit functionality)
- Make `QuoteCollectionListView` refresh `QuoteCollection` names on return from `QuoteListView` (the user can change the name of the selected `QuoteCollection` within the `QuoteListView`)
- Make `QuoteListView` show only the passed `QuoteCollection`'s `Quotes`
