## Description

An iOS app that makes it easy to collect, organize, and share text quotes

## Development Story

Developing this app was my first experience with Swift, iOS app development, and mobile app development in general, and it was both infuriating and delightful.

I began with merely an idea of an app that I would want to use to organize all of my favorite quotes (because despite the massive number of apps that exist, I could never find one dedicated to storing a personal collection of quotes, much less doing it _well_).

I used [this tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/27201015-dynamic-core-data-with-swiftui-tutorial-for-ios) as a template to build off of, and I learned the ins and outs of the Swift programming language and SwiftUI as I went along (with the help of countless other online tutorials, StackOverflow posts, and Apple's developer documentation).

Despite my lack of a formal education in iOS app development, I was able to put this thing together in about 3 weeks, and the final product is something I use everyday!
